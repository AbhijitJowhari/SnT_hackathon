# SnT_hackathon
The SnT_hacathon folder contains 4 files:
model.py
predictor.py
Vectorizer.py
user_data.csv

## Here's a brief desription of how to open our model on a localhost:

1) Download all the files in a folder
2) then run the files vectorizer.py and model.py
3) Then open Cmd for that folder
4) then run the command "streamlit run predictor 1.py"

Note: Here we haven't hosted the webpage till now as we were facing build issues with hosting services of streamlit which allows us to host streamlit sscripts.
